# Getting Started with Create React App

This repository is about Google Auth, where the user is asked to log in to the Google account to get the necessary permissions from the app.

For now, it only performs the following:
`Implicit flow`: requests the token, loads calendar events, and sends a new calendar event.
`Authorization code flow`: requests a code to send to the server.
